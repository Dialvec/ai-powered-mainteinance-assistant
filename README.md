# Intelligent Maintenance Assistant for Industrial Equipment 

## Business Context
A large manufacturing company operates factories across Europe. Each factory has hundreds of industrial machine (presses, pumps, robotic arms, CNC machines). Failures are costly and cause production delays.

The company wants to build an **AI-powered maintenance** assistant that can:
1. Predict machine failures before they happen.
2. Provide technicians with actionable troubleshooting guidance.
3. Expose the AI models and analytics through secure APIs.
4. Integrate into the company’s existing cloud/on‑prem hybrid infrastructure.
5. Maintain observability, monitoring, and drift detection for ML models.

## Deliverables
- High-level architecture diagram
- Component breakdown
- API design (FastAPI)
- Data ingestion + feature engineering plan
- Model design (ML + LLM)
- Deployment strategy (Azure ML + AKS)
- Monitoring + drift detection
- CI/CD pipeline
- Trade-offs and scalability considerations
